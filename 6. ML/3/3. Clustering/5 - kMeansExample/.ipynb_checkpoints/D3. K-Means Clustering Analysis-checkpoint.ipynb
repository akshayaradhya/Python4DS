    "We use the well known Iris data set to explore K-Means clustering further and use the heuristic \"elbow\" method to pick a \"good\" number of clusters. The Iris data set is found in the UCI Repository [1] but is also part of the Python test data.  Here we use SciPy and NumPy to do our computations so this data is already available in the SciPy distribution.  \n",

    "As per a discussion on StackOverflow [1] we use NumPy and SciPy to do k-means clustering on the well-known UN countries data set using number of clusters K = 1 to 10.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although we suspect that there are probably fewer than 10 natural clusters, this allows us to plot a measure called \"within cluster sum-of-squares\" vs. number of clusters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This measure tracks how \"tight\" a cluster is.  It operates on each cluster and adds up the squares of the distance of each point in a cluster from the centroid of the cluster.  That is, for each point in a cluster we take the distance between that point and the centroid of the cluster and square it.  We do this for each point in the cluster and then we sum it for that cluster.  Then we do this for each cluster.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a \"good\" or tight cluster, individual distances will be small and hence the sum of squares for that cluster be small.  For a \"bad\" or loose cluster the opposite is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now further, when we increase the value of K, the value of \"within-cluster-sum-of-squares\" will drop as we have more clusters hence smaller distances to centroids.  But each successive increase in K will not give the same drop.  At some point the improvement will start to level off.  We call that value of K the elbow and use that as the \"good\" value of K.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this now for the UN countries data set.  "
