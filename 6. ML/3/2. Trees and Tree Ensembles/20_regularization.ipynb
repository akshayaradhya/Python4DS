    "- $\\hat\\beta$ represents the set of two coefficients, $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$, which minimize the RSS for the **unregularized model**.\n",
    "- Regularization restricts the allowed positions of $\\hat\\beta$ to the **blue constraint region:**\n",
    "    - For lasso, this region is a **diamond** because it constrains the absolute value of the coefficients.\n",
    "    - For ridge, this region is a **circle** because it constrains the square of the coefficients.\n",
    "- The **size of the blue region** is determined by $\\alpha$, with a smaller $\\alpha$ resulting in a larger region:\n",

    "    - When $\\alpha$ increases, the blue region gets smaller and smaller.\n",

    "> The ellipses that are centered around $\\hat\\beta$ represent **regions of constant RSS**. In other words, all of the points on a given ellipse share a common value of the RSS. As the ellipses expand away from the least squares coefficient estimates, the RSS increases. Equations (6.8) and (6.9) indicate that the lasso and ridge regression coefficient estimates are given by the **first point at which an ellipse contacts the constraint region**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since **ridge regression** has a circular constraint with no sharp points, this intersection will not generally occur on an axis, and so the ridge regression coefficient estimates will be exclusively non-zero. However, the **lasso** constraint has corners at each of the axes, and so the ellipse will often intersect the constraint region at an axis. When this occurs, one of the coefficients will equal zero. In higher dimensions, many of the coefficient estimates may equal zero simultaneously. In Figure 6.7, the intersection occurs at $\\beta_1 = 0$, and so the resulting model will only include $\\beta_2$."
