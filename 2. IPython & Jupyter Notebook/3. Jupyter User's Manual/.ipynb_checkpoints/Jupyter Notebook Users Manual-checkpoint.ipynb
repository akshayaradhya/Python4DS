If you select \"Raw Cell Format,\" a tool bar that gives you several formatting options will appear in the corner of all your [Raw Cells][raw cells]. If you want to view and present your notebook as a slideshow, you can select \"Slideshow\" and a toolbar that enables you to organize your cells in to slides, sub-slides, and slide fragments will appear in the corner of every cell.

    "So, even if you have previously numbered your sections, Automatic Section Numbering will go through your document, delete the current section numbers, and replace them the correct number in a linear sequence.

You've unsurprisingly titled the section where you summarize and analyze this book **`2 Cats`**. Automatic Section Numbering will assume the number 2 is section information and delete it, leaving just the title **`Cats`** behind. If you bold, italicize, or place the title of the section inside quotes, however, the entire section title will be be preserved without any trouble. It should also be noted that even if you must title a section with a number occurring before any letters and you do not want to bold it, italicize it, or place it inside quotes, then you can always run Automatic Section Numbering and then go to that section and retype its name by hand. \n",

If, however, you have used a Header 3 Cell to indicate the beginning of what would have been section 2.1, Automatic Section Numbering will number that section 2.0.1 and an error message will appear telling you that \"You placed a Header 3 cell under a Header 2 Cell in section 2\". Similarly, if you begin your paper with any Header Cell smaller than a Header 1, say a Header 3 Cell, then Automatic Section Numbering will number your first section 0.0.3 and an error message will appear telling you that \"Notebook begins with a Header 3 Cell.\"\n"

Markdown is somewhat limited in its style options, which means that there are inherently fewer non-subject-specific concerns to agonize over while working. It is the conceit of this philosophy that you would, by using Markdown and this Notebook, begin to think of the specific stylistic rendering of your cells as distinct from what you type into those same cells, and thus also think of the content of your writing as necessarily separate from its formating and appearance.

If you include all the vertical bars on the far left and right of the table, like in the first example above, Markdown will ignore them completely. *But*, if you leave out some and include others, Markdown will interpret any extra vertical bar as an additional cell on the side that the bar appears in the unrendered version of the text.

    "Bibliographic Support makes managing references and citations in your Notebook much easier, by automating some of the bibliographic process every person goes through when doing research or writing in an academic context. There are essentially three steps to this process for which your Notebook's Bibliographic support can assist: gathering and organizing sources you intend to use, citing those sources within the text you are writing, and compiling all of the material you referenced in an organized, correctly formatted list, the kind which usually appears at the end of a paper in a section titled \"References,\" \"Bibliography,\" or \"Works Cited. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to benefit from this functionality, you need to do two things while writing your paper: first, you need to create a [Bibtex database][bibdb] of information about your sources and second, you must use the the [cite command][cc] in your Markdown writing cells to indicate where you want in-text citations to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do both these things, the \"Generate References\" button will be able to do its job by replacing all of your cite commands with validly formatted in-text citations and creating a References section at the end of your document, which will only ever include the works you specifically cited within in your Notebook. \n",

    "**Note:** References are generated without a header cell, just a [markdown header][]. This means that if you want a References section to appear in your table of contents, you will have to unrender the References cell, delete the \"References\" header, make a Header Cell of the appropriate level and title it \"References\" yourself, and then generate a table of contents using [Table of Contents Support][table of contents].

Bibtex entries can be in any cell and in any kind of cell in your **`Bibliography`** Notebook as long as the cell begins with **`<!--bibtex`** and ends with **`-->`**.

The best part of this is that any Notebook containing validly formatted [cite commands][cc] can check your external database and find only the items that you have indicated you want to cite.

    "Unlike [external bibliographic databases][exd], which are comprised from an entire separate notebook, internal bibliographic databases consist of only one cell within in the Notebook in which you are citing sources and compiling a References list. The single cell, like all of the many BibTex cells that can make up an external database, must begin with **`<!--bibtex`** and end with **`-->`** in order to be validly formatted and correctly interpreted by your Notebook's Bibliographic Support. It's probably best to keep this cell at the very end or the very beginning of your Notebook so you always know where it is.
